## Overview

The **User Authentication API** is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the integration of a backend API with a frontend application. The backend is built using Python's Flask framework, providing robust user authentication functionalities. The frontend is developed with React and TypeScript, offering a dynamic and type-safe user interface. This project showcases the seamless communication between the backend and frontend, emphasizing the creation of APIs that facilitate such interactions.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account with unique credentials.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users based on their credentials and provides access tokens.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Implements secure token-based authentication for session management.
- **Protected Routes**: Restricts access to certain API endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
- **Frontend Integration**: A React-based user interface that interacts with the backend API for authentication processes.

## Learning Outcomes
